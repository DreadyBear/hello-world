# hello-world
This is my little project from the official guides.github page

So this is a small part of my software engineering and java modules, but I know I will be using git and other version trackers in my career. I am feeling very intimidated by this second semmester already, I'm not ever sure about what questions I should be asking. It's a big bombardment of information and techninality, I can't believe that for the past 4 days all we've basically been doing is installing software! You would think that this is the easy part, but it is so complicated.
